Flags drape. Flags must be seen from a\r\ndistance and from their opposite side. Under these\r\ncircumstances, only simple designs make effective\r\nflags. Furthermore, complicated flags cost more to make,\r\nwhich often can limit how widely they are used.\r\n\r\nMost poor designs have the elements of a great\r\nflag in them—simplify them by focusing on a single\r\nsymbol, a few colors, large shapes, and no lettering.\r\n\r\nAvoid the temptation to include a symbol for everybody.\r\nIdeally the design will be reversible or at least\r\nrecognizable from either side. Don’t put a different\r\ndesign on the back. \r\n\r\n\r\nUse Meaningful Symbolism\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nSymbolism can be in the form of the “charge”\r\nor main graphic element, in the colors used, or\r\nsometimes even in the shapes or layout of the\r\nparts of the flag.\r\n\r\nUsually a single primary symbol is best—avoid\r\nthose that are less likely to be representative or unique.\r\nColors often carry meanings: red for blood or sacrifice,\r\nwhite for purity, blue for water or sky.\r\n\r\nDiagonal stripes are often used by former colonies\r\nas an alternative to the generally horizontal and vertical\r\nstripes of European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse 2 to 3 Basic Colors\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe basic flag colors are red, blue, green, black,\r\nyellow, and white. They can range from dark to\r\nlight. Occasionally other colors are also used, such\r\nas purple, gray, and orange, but they are seldom needed\r\nin a good design.\r\n\r\nSeparate dark colors with a light color, and light\r\ncolors with a dark color, to help them create effective\r\ncontrast. A good flag should also reproduce well in\r\n“grayscale”, that is, in black and white shades.\r\n\r\nMore than four colors are hard to distinguish and\r\nmake the flag unnecessarily complicated and expensive.\r\nFlag fabric comes in a relatively limited number of\r\ncolors—another reason to stick to the basics\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Lettering or Seals\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWords defeat the purpose: why not just write\r\n“U.S.A.” on a flag? A flag is a graphic symbol.\r\nLettering is nearly impossible to read from a\r\ndistance, hard to sew, and difficult to reduce to lapel–pin\r\nsize. Words are not reversible—this forces double– or\r\ntriple–thickness fabric.\r\n\r\nDon’t confuse a flag with a banner, such as what is\r\ncarried in front of a marching band in a parade, or draped\r\nbehind a speaker’s platform—such banners don’t flap,\r\nthey are seen from only one side, and they’re usually\r\nseen closer–up.\r\n\r\nSeals were designed for placement on paper to be\r\nread at close range. Very few are effective on flags—too\r\ndetailed. Better to use some element from the seal as a\r\nsymbol. Some logos work; most don’t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBe Distinctive or Be Related\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most difficult principle, but it\r\nis very important. Sometimes the good designs\r\nare already “taken”. However, a flag’s symbols,\r\ncolors, and shapes *can* recall other flags—a powerful\r\nway to show heritage, solidarity, or connectedness. This\r\nrequires knowledge of other flags.\r\n\r\nOften the best way to start the design process\r\ncan be looking to one’s “roots” in flags­—by country, tribe,\r\nor religion. Use some of the many resources available\r\nto help you with flag identification and history, such as\r\n“Flags of the World”: http://www.fotw.net, or your local\r\nlibrary\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Considerations\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nA rectangle is the standard flag shape. Keep the\r\nwidth–to–length proportions between 2:3 and 1:2.\r\nCanadian flags are usually 1:2; U.S. flags are usually\r\n2:3 or 3:5. Square flags are unusual in North America.\r\nAbandon such rectangles only when meaningful.\r\n\r\nFlags wear. By retaining a rectangular shape and\r\navoiding symbols at the fly end, a flag can be hemmed\r\nrepeatedly and given a longer life.\r\n\r\nThe point of honor is the “canton” area—the upper–\r\nleft corner. This corresponds to the part of the flag that is\r\nseen when it hangs limp from a flagpole. The center or\r\nleft–of–center position is the most visible spot for a\r\nsymbol when the flag is flying.\r\n\r\nConsider the fabrication methods. Curved lines add\r\nto the cost of sewn flags. Holes or “negative space” hurt\r\na flag’s fly–ability and wear–ability. “Swallow–tail” shapes\r\nfray more easily.\r\n\r\nAll rules have exceptions. Colorado’s “C” is a\r\nstunning graphic element. Maryland’s complicated\r\nheraldic quarters produce a memorable and distinctive\r\nflag. But depart from these five principles only with\r\ncaution and purpose.\r\n\r\nDon’t allow a committee to design a flag. Instead,\r\nempower individuals to design flags, and use a committee\r\nto select among them.\r\n\r\nAn old rule of heraldry has images of animals look\r\ntoward the hoist.\r\n\r\nAnd most of all, design a flag that looks\r\nattractive and balanced to the viewer and to the place,\r\norganization, or person it represents!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
