Construct a deep blue (HSL 154,255,80) canvas 300 units wide by 200 units tall. Call this the sea.

From the upper hoist corner, overlay a vivid deep green (HSL 85,255,65) parallelgram 200 units across the top, 200 units across the bottom, that reaches the bottom of the flag, and the hoist edge is offset flyward 100 units. The fly-edge bottom reaches the fly-edge bottom of the flag. Call the green the land.

Construct three equilateral triangles of bright yellow (HSL 38,255,128). The distance from the mass center to any point should be 52 units.  Arrange the first triangle's flat edge horizontal, and each other rotated from the mass center 40 degrees off the previous. Affix all to the center of the flag at each's mass center. Call this the sun, and each triangle that does not overlap any other constituent part a sunray.

Construct three count of darts of three different colors, total 9, colors, from the top cycling clockwise through intense coral-red (HSL 15,255,128), intense turquoise (HSL 128,255,128), and white (HSL 0,0,255), repeating. The darts inner and outer angles are 45 degrees, with each edge the same length as an edge of a protruded sunray. The darts lie between the sunrays, acute angles arranged radially. The distance between innermost corner and concave node between sunrays is colinear with one sunray tip on one side of dart with the midpoint of the sunray edge on the other side of the dart.
