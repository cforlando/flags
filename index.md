<h1>Flag Redesign</h1>
<h2>A Great City Deserves a Great Flag</h2>

When I tell people I am thinking about redesgining the flag for Orlando,
without fail I hear astonishment, not about the audacity of it, but
specifcially about the "re-" in re-designing. Long-time Orlando citizens have
no idea that we have a flag right now.

We do.

Regular citizens don't know we have a flag because no one flys it. It's obsure
because it's ugly and people who *do know about it*, don't like it enough to
show it off

Sure, it's ugly and dated and has no personality. Subjectivity aside,
there are some criteria already for what makes a good flag.

The Five Basic Rules for Flag Design
====================================

The North American Vexillological Association published a list of five criteria that flag designers should try to adhere to.

1. *Keep it Simple.*  The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory
2. *Use Meaningful Symbolism.* The flag’s images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes
3. *Use 2 to 3 basic colors.* Limit the number of colors on the flag to three, which contrast well and come from the standard color set
4. *No Lettering or Seals.* Never use writing of any kind or an organization’s seal
5. *Be Distinctive or Be Related.* Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections

Orlando's flag fails every one.

One of the only places you'll find Orlando's flag is in the wild, is at an
intersection right next to the Chamber of Commerce. That's the kind of
personality this flag has. It's only embraced by a Chamber of Commerce.

Orlando is pretty great. We deserve better than this.
